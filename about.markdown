# The -plot.- project  

I am a Bioinformatics and Data Scientist with a mission to bring life-saving targeted therapies to the right patient and, in turn, maximize success of clinical trials. Equipped with a unique combination of expertise in data science and biology, I lead and guide the full-stack analytical framework and workflow for an effective biomarker identification and patient stratification for Hummingbird Bioscience's early clinical phase antibodies.  

Broadly, I find great satisfaction in turning data into solutions, especially ones that impacts the life of others. In my weekend projects, I have built data visualization dashboards (shiny) to help others make apartment rental decisions, and whether a gene is essential in the developing zebrafish embryo. In trying to address bigger challenges (most times bigger than what I can do), I learn from others how to tackle these and make tutorials in this space.  

Please feel free to use anything useful on this blog, and you are also more than welcomed to contribute by dropping in suggestions and comments. If you have found any plots useful, a simple gratitude and acknowledgement of my work goes a long way.  Cheers! - Jason Lai
